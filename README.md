## Pets Warm-up

Create a new application (using express) that meets the following requirements:
- When a user visits the main page it should display a list of pets (name, type, gender).
- At the top of the page there should be a "create" button that takes you to a new page where you can create a new pet.
- When a user fills out and submits the form it should add them to the list of all pets on the home page.
Here's the twist, Do this with a partner. One of you should do only ejs while the other one should do only controller methods/routes! Communication is key to make sure everything works!
